          <h4>Focus on what actually matters.</h4>
          <p>
            This is not a tutorial where you learn a bunch of things in a very shallow way. You're going to get really damn good at JavaScript. Like a real programmer, you won't worry about the buzzword of the day because you'll have the fundamental skills to pick up things on your own.
          </p>
          <h4>Learn the JavaScript you need for professional web development.</h4>
          <p>
            Most courses focus on the syntax and features in JavaScript. You can go through resources like that all day long and not get anywhere. Practical JavaScript is totally different. It's 100% focused on how to build software so that you can actually make things.
